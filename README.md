## Internal DSL

Our internal DSL was made using Groovy, you can find it in the Internal_DSL folder of the project.

### How to build

In the Internal_DSL folder, use the script `build.sh` to get a Jar of our DSL located in its `/target` folder.

### How to use it

Use the Internal_DSL folder's `run.sh` script giving as argument the input program. The corresponding `.ino` file will be generated in the `result` folder.
