## Internal DSL

Our internal DSL was made using Groovy

### How to build

Use the script `build.sh` to get a Jar of our DSL located in the Internal_DSL folder in the `/target`.

### How to use it

Use the Internal_DSL folder's `run.sh` script giving as argument the input program. The corresponding `.ino` file will be generated in the `result` folder.
